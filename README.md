Here you can find examples demonstrating features of Ergo Framework 3.0 (and above).

## demo

This is an "umbrella"-example that demonstrates most of the Ergo Framework features. It was generated by `ergo` tool with just a single command. See `README.md` file in [demo](demo) for the details.

## call

This example project shows how to make synchronous requests to the local and remote processes. It starts two nodes (`node1@localhost` and `node2@localhost`); `node1` spawns processes `a` and `b`; `node2` spawns process `b`. Process `a` is making `Call` requests sequentially to the process `b` on `node1@localhost` (locally) and to the process `b` on `node2@localhost` (remotely)

## events
Ergo Framework provides the "Events" feature that implements the distributed "Publisher/Subscriber" design pattern. This example demonstrates this feature in action. It starts node `node-pub@localhost` with a producer process and second node `node-sub@localhost` with two consumer processes.

## erlang

This example demonstrates how the node built with Ergo Framework and enabled Erlang network stack natively communicates with the Erlang node.

## websocket
The following example starts Web server with websocket-handler at "/" and spawns 3 processes to handle websocket-connections.
